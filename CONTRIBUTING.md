# Contributing to MCP4Go

We love your input! We want to make contributing to MCP4Go as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the project's style guidelines.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

- Follow standard Go code style guidelines as outlined in [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go) and [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
- Use `gofumpt` & `goimports` to format your code.
- Run `golint` and `go vet` before submitting code.
- Use meaningful variable, function, and package names.
- Write comprehensive comments and documentation.

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and feature requests. Report a bug or suggest a feature by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/mcp4go/mcp4go/issues/new).

### Bug Reports

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

1. What version of Go and MCP4Go are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

### Feature Requests

When suggesting a feature, please provide:

1. A clear explanation of the feature
2. Motivation for the feature
3. Possible implementation approaches
4. Whether you're willing to implement it yourself
